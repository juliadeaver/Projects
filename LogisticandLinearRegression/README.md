# Projects Using Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

Name: Julia Deaver

All projects were created as a student at the University of Virginia. Collaborators are named within each project file.

## Project
This project is an analysis of data from a kaggle dataset. This dataset contains data about houses in Seattle. The link for this dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivachandel/kc-house-data. In this project two questions are asked. One question is answered using a linear regression while the other is answered using a logistic regression. This project demonstrates my ability to code in R and to create both linear and logistic regressions using R.
